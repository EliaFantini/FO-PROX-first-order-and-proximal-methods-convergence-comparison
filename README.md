Implementation of different first order (FO) methods and proximal gradient methods: Gradient descent (GD), Gradient descent strongly convex (GDstr), Accelerated gradient descent (AGD), Accelerated gradient descent strongly convex (AGDstr), Accelerated gradient descent with restart (AGDR), Adaptive Gradient Method (AdaGrad), Stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Stochastic averaging gradient (SAG), Stochastic gradient descent with variance reduction (SVR), Subgradient method (SubG), Iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA), Fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (and with restart) (FISTA and FISTAR), Stochastic proximal gradient method (prox_sg). 

For a more detailed explanation of the terms mentioned above, please read *Exercise instructions.pdf*, it contains also some theoretical questions answered in *Answers.pdf* (handwritten). 

The project was part of an assignment for the EPFL course [EE-556 Mathematics of data: from theory to computation](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/mathematics-of-data-from-theory-to-computation-EE-556). The backbone of the code structure to run the experiments was already given by the professor and his assistants, what I had to do was to implement the core of the optimization steps, which are the FO and proximal methods algorithms and other minor components. Hence, every code file is a combination of my personal code and the code that was given us by the professor.

The following image shows an example of the output figures of the code **run_comparison.py**. All plots show a comparison of convergence speed for different optimization methods, the y-axis shows how far the model is from its optimum (the smaller, the less far, the better)

The following image shows an example of the output figures of the code **run_theoretical_vs_emprical_conv_rate.py**. It's a comparison between the theoretical upper bound of the optimization method and the actual empirical convergence rate.

## How to install and reproduce results
Download this repository as a zip file and extract it into a folder
The easiest way to run the code is to install Anaconda 3 distribution (available for Windows, macOS and Linux). To do so, follow the guidelines from the official
website (select python of version 3): https://www.anaconda.com/download/

Additional package required are: 
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- scipy

To install them write the following command on Anaconda Prompt (anaconda3):
```shell
cd *THE_FOLDER_PATH_WHERE_YOU_DOWNLOADED_AND_EXTRACTED_THIS_REPOSITORY*
```
Then write for each of the mentioned packages:
```shell
conda install *PACKAGE_NAME*
```
Some packages might require more complex installation procedures. If the above command doesn't work for a package, just google "How to install *PACKAGE_NAME* on *YOUR_MACHINE'S_OS*" and follow those guides.

Finally, run **run_comparison.py** and **run_theoretical_vs_emprical_conv_rate.py**. 
```shell
python run_comparison.py
python run_theoretical_vs_emprical_conv_rate.py
```
